*Planning out one's projects explicitly can help you to be intentional
about your work and what they are trying to achieve through it. It's
also a way of creating tighter feedback loops, both from others and
yourself.*

*As always, the prompts here are intended to be helpful, and you should
amend or ignore those that don't feel right. If you would like to modify

you see fit.*

# The project

### Describe the project in 2-5 sentences.

-   Test "Training Language Models with Natural Language Feedback" on
    new OpenAI critique dataset

    -   100 training examples -\> 13000 examples (OpenAI dataset)

    -   If the algorithm incorporates human feedback on the new as well
        as it did on the original dataset, it's a success. (e.g. shows
        generalizability of algorithm)

-   So main goal is to advance outer alignment research.

-   Publish results (as part of Jérémy's next paper)

### What is the purpose of this project? Why do you want to do it?

-   Get more familiar with state of the art LM (GPT-3)

-   Advancing outer alignment methods

### What are the goals and subgoals of the project?

-   Write my first paper

-   Publish my first paper

-   Build portfolio and network to find employment at AI safety
    organization

### How will you know if it's worked?

*What would be different about the world if this project worked versus
if it didn't? Is there any way of measuring or verifying whether those
changes happen?*

-   Find employment afterwards / continue collaboration with mentor
    (Jérémy)

-   Paper gets published on Arxiv by the end of September (1 month after
    project finishes)

# Approaching the project

### What are you going to do during this project period? 

Consider setting milestones that are

-   Specific,

-   Measurable,

-   Attainable by the end of this summer and in this environment,

-   Relevant to your goals,

-   Time-bound, i.e. come with a deadline.

Approach:

1.  Set up weekly goals and make it public (accountability structure)

2.  Set up Github repository for project

3.  Read the necessary papers:

    a.  Get familiar with OpenAI critique paper

    b.  Get familiar with OpenAI learning to summarize from human
        feedback paper

    c.  Jeremy paper

4.  Replicate Jérémy's paper with smaller model (e.g GPT-2)

5.  Do Data Analysis of Critique dataset

6.  Apply Jeremy algorithm to OpenAI dataset

7.  Use OpenAI API to implement code from step 4

8.  Iterate on results (e.g Hyperparameter Tuning)

9.  Write up a draft of my results

10. Get Feedback

11. Finish draft

12. Publish brief summary on LW

### What are your biggest uncertainties about what you should do?

### How could you acquire information that would reduce these uncertainties?

### What failure modes are you worried about? (Imagine you failed; can you guess why?)

### How could you avoid or mitigate these failure modes?

### What can help you? Who can help you? (Who can already do this?)
