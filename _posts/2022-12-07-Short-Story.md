# A fun short story that never happened

 The Basics:

#TODO
Explain the "Wing It" game and it's rules!!! 

# Time used:
-	35 minutes
-	11.07.22

# Situation:
You are a kindergarten teacher at a very exclusive private elementary school. While you were in the bathroom, a little girl used a magnifying glass to ignite a stack of papers, and now all three floors of the building are on fire and full of precious children. The elevators have shut down, and there’s heavy smoke in the staircase.

# Resources:
1.	Eight boxes of baking powder (soda), assorted brands
2.	20%-off coupon to Bed, Bath and Beyond
3.	Parachute
4.	Helicopter
5.	Hang glider

# Story:
The other day I learned something extraordinary about the safety features of baking soda, parachutes, and coupons. 
It was a regular Monday morning at the kindergarten when it struck 12:13 o’clock. That’s when I usually take a coffee break. That is, not a break to drink coffee but rather a break to get rid of the delicate side products the coffee makes me produce. 
Here’s something you need to know: I really like to squeeze out every ounce of my coffee break. Wait, that came out the wrong way. Man, somehow that too. I’m on a run!!
Anyhow, I took my time enjoying the breaking news about how something funny like any self-respecting teacher does when my nose detected a rather discomforting smell. And no, I’m not talking about my wonderful coffee side product. 
It was a rather smokey smell, which is weird, because we usually don’t schedule our weekly fart lighting contest until Thursday. 
In short succession I heard multiple people break out in tears and cry. Again, highly unusual, since my colleague Robert usually only cries on Friday when it’s time to say goodbye to his favorite children. Moreover, he was on vacation. 

As you can see, I got seriously confused. So I pulled up my pants as fast as possible and left the toilet to see what was going on. And no, I have to disappoint you, I did not forget to mention the part where I whipped my tender buttox. 

Leaving the loo, I turned around and discovered that a little girl named Lilly used a magnifying glass to ignite a stack of papers, and now all three floors of the building were on fire and full of precious children. 
You surely understand my surprise when I saw this. Just last week I was about to send Lily’s parents a letter to notify them about her poor performance in science class and yet here she was, applying a magnifying glass to foster a world class inferno. I was proud, to say the very least! Lilly finally learned the fine arts of combustion, I’m an awesome teacher: Check!
I know, I know. You’re probably thinking: “Science class in kindergarten” that’s nuts? Well, I absolutely agree, these overly ambitious helicopter parents simply find more and more ways to get their kids to become the next Elon Musk. Not that it would bother me. I’m quite glad actually. These little brats are the perfect audience for the lonesome PhD archetype that I am. I mean, common guys:  I can geek around about sciency stuff all day long without having to fear any intellectual retaliation. They don’t ask any pesky questions and just nod, as if they understood. They are so much better than most of the students I’ve worked with over the years.  It’s a win win. 
Putting aside the important stuff, we can redirect our attention to that tini tiny flame I mentioned earlier. Right, so there’s this huge fire, bunches of screaming children and a brilliant 3 year pyromaniac.
So I’m thinking: my main priority is to get everybody out of the building. Well, everyone except for nosy Nate. That tiny monster recently attacked me with a specialty of his: boggers and snot soup. You can probably guess why he’s been giving the rather accurate nickname.
Now I’d like to invite you to put yourself into my shoes: “Your’re on the pre to last floor and it seems like all ways down are blocked, the only rooms on this floor are the kitchen, the toilet and the super-duper shut-eye slumber sanctuary.” Yes, you heard me right, imagine saying this 3 times a day to get 30 tiny fuckers up to the 3rd floor of the building: “Hey hey you little sweethearts, it’s time to frequent the super-duper shut-eye slumber sanctuary”. I always said, we shouldn’t have appointed Kathrin to “Supreme Room Name Selector”. First of all, after she was done with her duties – on the first day of work, who could’ve imagined – it wasn’t long before she started naming other things.  Then again, we have too much money anyway and Kathrin doesn’t have any talents so doing the math on this one, I think we’re fine. At the very least we’re better off because Kathrine is not let loose on the children.

Where was I? Right, that’s the wrong question. Where were you? Now that you can see in what quandary I found myself, try and ask yourself what you’d do next? 
Correct: “Baking powder”. That was my first instinct as well. Oh, why baking powder? I’m glad that you asked. According to Wikipedia, backing powder has an amazing ability to extinguish fires. At least that’s what I learned sitting on the toilet preparing my next science lesson. 
30 kids, a tiny flame and Eight boxes of baking powder assorted brands of course, that was gonna be a hit lecture. What I didn’t know is that the flame would be substituted by a raging hell fire, but as every great teacher, I had to rise to the occasion. Besides, the hotter the flame, the starker the effect. Every good magician knows that. Although the good ones probably stay professional and call their assistants something else.
Right as I was about to unpack one of the boxes of backing powder my group of kids froze in a sudden shock of realization. Some started pointing at the backing powder and started waiving their hands frantically. 
Taking this as a sign that they were ready for the magic, I opened up a pack and threw it in the fire. Fireworks, combustion, surprise and disgust. Those were the emotions I felt when I realized, that I’d misread the Wikipedia article. It wasn’t baking powder that extinguished fire, but rather baking soda. The powder itself is highly combustible and created an immediate shockwave of heat and disillusionment in my pupils: “Their bellowed teacher made a fatal mistake”. 
Taken aback by my failure and the loss of eyebrows I endured because of the jet of flame I watched in surprise as my students identified a pack of backing soda in the kitchen. They put out the flame and helped me get back on my feet to climb the staircase and make it out on the rooftop. (Wow, these tiny twats are brilliant – it’s surely not me who taught them that.)
From here on it was a breeze. The kids and I were finally free, breathing some fresh air, taking in the beautiful view from our luxurious penthouse kindergarten in the Hills of Los MoneyCanBuyAnythingExceptSmartKindergartenTeachers. In a short instance we forgot that the building was crumbling underneath our feet which is why we had to act quickly. 
Fortunately, enough we were not alone on the rooftop. A beautiful black M-372 pantera helicopter was waiting for me to mount it. You’re probably thinking: “A helicopter in a kindergarten, yeah, as if.“ I mean yeah, we’re loaded. I did mention we’re a private kindergarten right? Damn peasants.
Anyway, a couple of weeks later it’s time for the big moment. I’m getting my medal of honor. At least that’s what I was thinking. 
We’re standing in the majors hall. Suited up and freshly bathed I’m thinking to myself: Damn today’s the day, you’re looking hella good in your high school suit. But to be honest I possibly looked kinda funny with one quarter of an eyebrow.  Anyway, my mom said that I would never need the suit again, but here I was, showing here wrong. Isn’t that what it’s all about? 
Instead of the long awaited medal of honor I’m given a small box with something marvelous inside. It’s a 20%-off coupon to Bed, Bath and Beyond
