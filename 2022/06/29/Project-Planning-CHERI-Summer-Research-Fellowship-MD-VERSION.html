<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Test “Training Language Models with Natural Language Feedback” on
new OpenAI critique dataset</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>100 training examples -&gt; 13000 examples (OpenAI dataset)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If the algorithm incorporates human feedback on the new as well
as it did on the original dataset, it’s a success. (e.g. shows
generalizability of algorithm)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So main goal is to advance outer alignment research.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-you-going-to-do-during-this-project-period">What are you going to do during this project period?</h3>

<p>Consider setting milestones that are</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Specific,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Measurable,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attainable by the end of this summer and in this environment,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Relevant to your goals,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time-bound, i.e. come with a deadline.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Approach:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Set up weekly goals and make it public (accountability structure)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set up Github repository for project</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Read the necessary papers:</p>

    <p>a.  Get familiar with OpenAI critique paper</p>

    <p>b.  Get familiar with OpenAI learning to summarize from human
    feedback paper</p>

    <p>c.  Jeremy paper</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Replicate Jérémy’s paper with smaller model (e.g GPT-2)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do Data Analysis of Critique dataset</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apply Jeremy algorithm to OpenAI dataset</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use OpenAI API to implement code from step 4</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Iterate on results (e.g Hyperparameter Tuning)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write up a draft of my results</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get Feedback</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finish draft</p>
  </li>
